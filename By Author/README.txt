 The .ino files contained here are designed for use with an Arduino Uno or Duemilanove. Although only some code snippets are included right now I intend to go back and add wiring diagrams 
and building instructions to build the various projects listed here.

Have fun, feel free to submit a pull request on GitHub for any of your own projects to be included.
