Several fundamental elements of Arduino control are showcased within these examples, and also provide a clear introduction into the syntax of `Wiring`, the native language for Arduino projects, written and run within the official `Processing IDE`. All examples can either be run via the Processing IDE, with the microcontroller attached via a USB cable, or the code may be uploaded to the Arduino's flash memory and run as a standalone, pre-programmed device.\r\n\r\n*Directories In Arduino.cc:*\r\n\r\n    Arduino/Analog\r\n    Arduino/Basics\r\n    Arduino/Communication\r\n    Arduino/Control\\ Structures\r\n    Arduino/Digital\r\n    Arduino/Display\r\n    Arduino/Sensors\r\n    Arduino/Strings\r\n\r\n\r\n**96 LED Cube [dev branch]**\r\n\r\nLocated on the dev branch is an LED light cube project that is still under development. The cube, consisting of six 4 x 4 LED light panels, demonstrates the ability to create light animations via timing and control of digital I/O pin states. \r\n\r\nWith only 96 lights, this cube is an example of `multiplexing` and relatively simple from an electrical wiring standpoint. Larger scale light demonstrations can be created through the use of the `charlieplexing` system of wiring the device, allowing an Arduino's small number of analog and digital I/O pins to drive a much larger LED light array via a system of `tri-state logic`.\r\n\r\n\r\n+ *Charlieplexing on Wikipedia:*\r\n\r\n    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlieplexing\r\n\r\n\r\n+ *Video: LED Array Utilizing Charlieplexing*\r\n\r\n    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mXM-oGggrM\r\n\r\n\r\n+ *Explanation of the Charlieplexing Theory:*\r\n\r\n    http://www.instructables.com/id/Charlieplexing-LEDs--The-theory/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
